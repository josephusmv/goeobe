package eobetests is about testing the coordinates of 
    eobe API, DB, cltmgmt, load
This package will not includes HTTP and parser and other tests.
But the output(verify data) will be reused as HTTP and parser module tests.

This package tests those four modules through some simulated feature actions defined in XxxXtst/testplan.txt

All test commands:
1. go test -v -run AsAdminUserMgmt 
    Simulate an administrator action
2. go test -v -run UserActions
    Simultaneously run 6 users with go routine, to simulate real HTTP concurrency
3. go test -v -run UserExpires
    Test User login and expire events, without DB testing due to DB expire issue on some machine.
4. go test -v -run FileUpload
    Test File Upload and save API, DB storage for FILE path involved.

1. Redirect API and HTTP
    User need to have a redirect after some request.

2. Strongger DB functions:
    e.g.: One Query Define for an search to all values may support following:
        --> All rows
        --> Rows index 0-1, 5-6, 7-11....Partially return(may need API and support in current version)
        --> support one query define with different where condition selection:  
            Where:  permission>?  AND username=? AND title=?
            Could works sepereately as 
                Where:  permission>?  AND username=? AND title=?
                Where:  permission>?  
                Where:  permission>?  AND title=?
                Where:  username=?  AND title=?
                ....
3. DB cache should be considered with cltmngmt and SID, --- eobescl: storage cache layer
    add a new DB cache package(layer), between DB and API
    Support change DB package from that new DBCache Layer
